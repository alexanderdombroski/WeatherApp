# Overview

Free APIs are the best!

This is a basic weather iOS app that uses Open Weather Map's API to show weather data in the location of the users choice. It has multiple views for managing locations, and viewing the weather. It saves locations persistantaly so they don't have to be inputed again.

I created this app to gain more experience with Swift and also learn to use APIs. I learned some good design concepts and got lot's of practice with type casting to navigate the API's data.

# Development Environment

Tools
* XCode - IDE available on apple app store
* Swift - programming language for iOS apps

Libraries
* SwiftUI - Makes it easy to generate UI elements and style them
* Foundation - Contains older code functionalities and was useful for working with dates and timestamps
* SwiftData - Used to make class data persistant

# Useful Websites

* [Hacking with Swift Forums](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums) - Questions in these forums are commonly answered and very helpful. 
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) - Contained all the documentation I needed to fetch data from the API (for free)
* [Luke Roberts Blog](https://lukeroberts.co/blog/fetch-data-api/) - This and other websites helped with loading in data from a URL

# Future Work

* Add data about wind
* Ability to switch temperature types
* UI Improvements
